<h2>This will be a small synopsis of my JavaScript learning curve</h2>

<p>If you want to learn a language or a skill, such as github, you have to be willing<br>
to do some work. You have to go through the examples and actually type them in yourself<br>
this is what I'm about to do with JavaScript and GitHub.

<p>I wonder if it allows the use of css scripting too
